# 1701QCA Making Interaction - Assessment 2 workbook

## Project working title ##
*The Kitchen Wheel.*

### Related project 1 ###
*Spinner Activity*

*https://makecode.microbit.org/lessons/spinner/activity*

This project is related to mine because it also has a spinner wheel, and it has similar ideas to what I have planned for this project.

### Related project 2 ###
*Lucky Wheel*

*https://makecode.adafruit.com/projects/lucky-wheel/code*

This project is related to mine because I am thinking of designing a wheel that randomly selects a different ingredient each time, and this project has a very similar idea to mine. 

### Related project 3 ###
*Dice*

*https://makecode.adafruit.com/examples/dice*

This project is related to mine because this projects runs on the concept of chance and luck, and frankly, so does mine. 

### Related project 4 ###
*RC Car*

*http://chibibit.io/ide/docs/projects/rc-car.html*

This project is related to mine because both this current project that I am working on and this related car project are both considered as 'toys', so they are both used to entertain people and to bring some fun into life. They can also both be good projects to work on during the Covid-19 pandemic as everybody is stuck inside. 

### Related project 5 ###
*Reaction*

*https://makecode.adafruit.com/examples/reaction*

This project is related to mine because both of these projects are based on reactions and on patience. They can also both be considered as fun games. 

### Related project 6 ###
*Hot Potato*

*https://makecode.adafruit.com/projects/hot-potato*

This project is related to mine because both of these projects are considered as 'entertaining' as they are both technically games. 

## Other research ##
*Include here any other relevant research you have done. This might include identifying readings, tutorials, videos, technical documents, or other resources that have been helpful. For each particular source, add a comment or two about why it is relevant or what you have taken from it.*

### *Brief resource name/description* ###

*Provide a link, reference, or whatever is required for somebody else to find the resource. Then provide a few comments about what you have drawn from the resource.*

## Conceptual progress ##

### Design intent ###
*Include your design intent here. It should be about a 10 word phrase/sentence.*

### Design concept 1 ###
*Outline three design concepts, each developed to a point where you anticipate it would be feasible to complete by the end of the course. Each should have a summary of the idea, a rough sketch of what it might be like, and any other notes you created while exploring the idea.* 

*Put the first two design concepts in the sections "Design concept 1" and "Design concept 2". Then put the third, with more development in the section "Final design concept".*

### Design concept 2 ###
*Put details here.*

### Final design concept ###
*This more fully developed concept should include consideration of the interaction scheme, technical functionality, fabrication approach, materials to be used, and aesthetic.*

### Interaction flowchart ###
*Draw a draft flowchart of what you anticipate the interaction process in your project to be. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible.*

## Physical experimentation documentation ##

*In this section, show your progress including whichever of the following are appropriate for your project at this point.
a.	Technical development. Could be code screenshots, pictures of electronics and hardware testing, video of tests. 
b.	Fabrication. Physical models, rough prototypes, sketches, diagrams of form, material considerations, mood boards, etc.
Ensure you include comments about the choices you've made along the way.*

*You will probably have a range of images and screenshots. Any test videos should be uploaded to YouTube or other publicly accessible site and a link provided here.*

## Design process discussion ##
*Discuss your process in getting to this point, particularly with reference to aspects of the Double Diamond design methodology or other relevant design process.*

## Next steps ##
*Write a list or provide other information about your plan to move the project forward to be ready to present by video and documentation in week 12 of the course.*
